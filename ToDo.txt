pause button for route route map

store points of interest? title and descriptiom, another array of objects?
add picture taking functionality to points of interest..

settings page - quick exercise, hiking trip, holiday recording etc..

create 'are you sure' modal for delete trip buttons,
replace delete buttons with a checkbox, once any have been checked show delete 

ok, so, working at variable interval for getting location BUT the replay needs to know what that is...
also need to know if isRecording in settings so cannot change interval whilst recording, otherwise its all gonna go to shit..
add an interval prop to journey data..
introduce an isRecording context..
routeMap timer only updates from given points so really needs to be on the counter rather..
