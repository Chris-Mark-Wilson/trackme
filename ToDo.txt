keep awake / run in background, cannot atm run while phone goes to standby or under another app
sort out speed calculation if points are missing, shows wildly varying speeds atm
ensure app follows user on a trip, currently needs manual recentering
adjust zoom level auto to fit entire trip on screen, have an auto/manual toggle and maybe a slider to set zoom one handed
set playback to centre on marker, adjustable zoom as before

ok the rn-background-timer does not link in expo 
so need to use expo-backgrounde-fetch to run tasks in the background..
